# 1. Create 3 variables to store street, city and country, now create address variable to
# store entire address. Use two ways of creating this variable, one using + operator and the other using f-string.
# Now Print the address in such a way that the street, city and country prints in a separate line
street = "13 patli gali"
city = "New Delhi"
country = "India"
address = street + '\n' + city + '\n' + country
print("Address using + operator:",address)
address = f'{street}\n{city}\n{country}'
print("Address using f-string:",address)

# 2. Create a variable to store the string "Earth revolves around the sun"
#     1. Print "revolves" using slice operator
#     2. Print "sun" using negative index
s='Earth revolves around the sun'
print(s[6:14])
print(s[-3:])

# 3. Create two variables to store how many fruits and vegetables you eat in a day.
# Now Print "I eat x veggies and y fruits daily" where x and y presents vegetables and fruits that you eat everyday.
# Use python f string for this.
num_fruits=10
num_veggies=5
print(f"I eat {num_veggies} veggies and {num_fruits} daily")

# 4. I have a string variable called s='maine 200 banana khaye'. This of course is a
# wrong statement, the correct statement is 'maine 10 samosa khaye'.
# Replace incorrect words in original strong with new ones and print the new string.
# Also try to do this in one line.
s='maine 200 banana khaye'
s=s.replace('banana','samosa')
s=s.replace('200','10')
print("Using two line replace:",s)

s='maine 200 banana khaye'
s=s.replace('banana','samosa').replace('200','10')
print("Using single line:",s)
