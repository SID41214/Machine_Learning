# Exercise: Functions in python
1. Write a function called calculate_area that takes base and height as an input and returns and area of a triangle. Equation of an area of a triangle is,
```
area = (1/2)*base*height
```

2. Modify above function to take third parameter shape type. It can be either "triangle" or "rectangle". Based on shape type it will calculate area. Equation of rectangle's area is,
```
rectangle area=length*width
```
If no shape is supplied then it should take triangle as a default shape

3. Write a function called print_pattern that takes integer number as an argument and prints following pattern if input number is 3,
```
*
**
***
```
if input is 4 then it should print
```
*
**
***
****
```
Basically number of lines it prints is equal to that number. (Hint: you need to use two for loops)
