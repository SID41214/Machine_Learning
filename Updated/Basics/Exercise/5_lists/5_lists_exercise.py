#

# 5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
# got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
# based on this

exp = [2200,2350,2600,2130,2190]

# 1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
print("In feb this much extra was spent compared to jan:",exp[1]-exp[0]) # 150

# 2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year
print("Expense for first quarter:",exp[0]+exp[1]+exp[2]) # 7150

# 3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
print("Did I spent 2000$ in any month? ", 2000 in exp) # False

# 4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
exp.append(1980)
print("Expenses at the end of June:",exp) # [2200, 2350, 2600, 2130, 2190, 1980]

# 5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and

# 2. You have a list of your favourite marvel super heros
# heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']
# Using this list

heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']
# 1. Length of the list
print(len(heros))
# 2. Add 'black panther' at the end of this list
heros.append('black panther')
print(heros)
# 3. You realize that you need to add 'black panther' after 'hulk',
# so remove it from the list first and then add it after 'hulk'
heros.remove('black panther')
heros.insert(3,'black panther')
print(heros)
# 4. Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :)
#    So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool).
#    Do that with one line of code.
heros[1:3]=['doctor strange']
print(heros)
# 5. Sort the list in alphabetical order
heros.sort()
print(heros)
