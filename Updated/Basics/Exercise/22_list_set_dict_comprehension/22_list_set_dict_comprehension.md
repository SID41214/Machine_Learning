## Exercise: List Set Dict Comprehensions


1. Create a Dictionary which contains the Binary values mapping with numbers found in the below integer and binary and save it in binary_dict. 

Example :
```
    integer = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    binary = ["0", "1", "10", "11", "100"]
    binary_dict = {0:"0", 1:"1", 2:"10", 3: "11", 4:"100"}
```

2. Create a List which contains additive inverse of a given integer list. 
An additive inverse `a` for an integer `i` is a number such that:
```
a + i = 0
```
Example:
```
integer = [1, -1, 2, 3, 5, 0, -7]
additive_inverse = [-1, 1, -2, -3, -5, 0, 7]
```

3. Create a set which only contains unique sqaures from a given a integer list.
```
integer = [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]
sq_set = {1, 4, 9}
```
